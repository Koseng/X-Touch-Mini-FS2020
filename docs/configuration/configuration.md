# Configuration
The configuration of the application is done through json files.

## Overview
The configuration files can be found in the `Configurations` folder. There is one global configuration file `config.json` and seperate configs for airplanes. The `config.schema.json` is for your text editor so it can help you autocomplete or highlight potential erros. The Functions directory contains the jinja2 functions that are part of conditional triggers. This is an advanced topic.

## Editing
The recommended editor for modifying the config files is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). When working on the jinja2 functions install the [Better Jinja](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=samuelcolvin.jinjahtml) for syntax highlighting.
